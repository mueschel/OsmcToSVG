OSMC To SVG
===========

A simple generator of SVG images based on Openstreetmap osmc:symbol tags.

The repository contains a small sandbox web page, a generate script and the actual image generating function.

This project is licensed CC0. However, a link back to the original repository (https://github.com/mueschel/OsmcToSVG) is highly appreciated.
